						<h2>A story of success...</h2>
						<p>	
						Welcome to Marvel Entertainment. This site was written by Vincent Truong. Marvel Studios and Marvel TV have been killing it these past years. Their success has been nothing
						but astounding. Starting with the first Iron Man in 2008 which set the bar high. Then came The Incredible Hulk. The next was Thor. A movie that could've
						been too weird for audiences but they found the humanity and groundedness and gave us a great film. Arguably the hardest of the solo films, Captain America: The First Avenger, this film could've came off
						too cheesy and stiff, but they told a very human, and relatable story with Steve Rogers. They put out all their solo films to general success but the biggest challenged remained.
						</p>	
						<br>
						
						<p>
						Putting together a film with crossovers from 4 previous films before it is a very RISKY move. Had one of those films failed, then the entire ship would sink. Yet they didn't, and in 2012, The Avengers
						came out to roaring success. It was incredible, funny, full of heart, and action. It paid off on the investment audiences gave over those previous four years. The crossovers felt natural, organic and earned.
						Marvel truly delivered on their promise of a cinematic universe.
						</p>
						<br>
						
						<p>
						And they're not stopping. They keep growing their characters and bringing in new ones that audiences love. They've turned a virtual band of
						unknown characters in the Guardians of the Galaxy into A-list, highly popular characters. They came out with one of their strongest films in Captain America: Winter Soldier, a politcal thriller that shook up the MCU
						and proved Marvel can diversify the genre and story of their films. 
						They've become so strong that they can introduce crazy characters like Dr. Strange and audiences easily accept it.
						Recently, they came out with Captain America: Civil War, a tour de force in storytelling that successfully balanced 12+ main heroes yet still told a very powerful, emotional story about the political and personl 
						divide between Iron Man and Captain America. They did all this while introducing Black Panther and Spiderman into the universe in excellent portrayals.
						</p>
						<br>
						
						<p>They've branched out to TV with their Netflix shows which have been critically successful and loved for their darker tone, character development, and action sequences. With four 13-hour shows in Daredevil,
						Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and soon Iron Fist. They've set in motion the epic 8-hour crossover The Defenders and they're on their way to dominate Netflix as well.
						</p>
						<br>
						
						<p>But the BIGGEST movies are not here yet. Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers 4 is the biggest movie they've done yet. Featuring all the heroes and supporting characters they've introduced so far, the two films
						will capitalize on the years of build-up and pit the Avengers against Thanos in a battle that's been planned ever since the universe started. From start to finish, shot in IMAX, these two films will the biggest in
						movie history, with the biggest ensemble cast ever put together.
