						to safeguard the world</p>
						</p>
						<br>

						</p>
						<br>

						<img src="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTbUWVX-6eusHp85uW6cbtbwzrW5UtBXgpc2FkCQEJ_YUO574gO" height="300" width="200" />
						<br>
						<br><p>Thrilling sequel to Iron Man that expands the Tony Stark character while laying seeds for the cinematic universe.</p>
						<br>
						
						<h4>Thor (2011)</h4>
						<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fc/Thor_poster.jpg" height="300" width="200" />
						<br>
						<br><p>A movie whose out-of-this-world setting could've derailed it, yet the story of Thor, an arrogant man who learns humility through the human struggle rung true with audiences. Instead, its sprawling
						and operatic setting of Asgard was a fascinating tale.</p>
						</p>
						<br>
						
						<h4>Captain America: The First Avenger (2011)</h4>
						<img src="http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQxM9vgeSWLNfQ46gItm926mnual8QWSVyUTAy6HSefuJqeyFWs" height="300" width="200" />
						<br>
						<br><p>The movie about the first Avenger, Captain America. A very underrated tale about goodness and humanity. The story of Steve Rogers' origin was a very heartfelt and exciting tale.</p>
						</p>
						<br>
						
						<h4>The Avengers (2012)</h4>
						<img src="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/custom/Blog_Images/avengers-movie-poster-1.jpg" height="300" width="200" />
						<br>
						<br><p>The SMASH success movie that was a result of four movies and years of hard work came together in a very fun, heartful and exciting movie. It proved that a shared universe had potential
						and it delivered on that potential, changing the cinematic and blockbuster landscape forever.</p>
						</p>
						<br>
						
						<h3>PHASE 2</h3>
						<h4>Iron Man 3 (2013)</h4>
						<img src="http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/iron-man-3-international-poster.jpg" height="300" width="200" />
						<br>
						<br><p>The third film in the Iron Man trilogy. The divisive film was a very smartly told one bringing Tony Stark back to his roots, stripping him of his armor, showing that he is more than
						the suit and that it is his intelligence and creativity that makes him Iron Man not the suit. The movie smartly commented on the state of Terrorism in America and the Middle East with its
						creative villain choices.</p>
						</p>
						<br>
						
						<h4>Thor: The Dark World (2013)</h4>
						<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7e/Thor_-_The_Dark_World_poster.jpg" height="300" width="200" />
						<br>
						<br><p>Although regarded as the worst of the MCU, The Dark World still had a good story of brotherhood, epic battles, and high-scale setting.</p>
						</p>
						<br>
					
						<h4>Captain America: Winter Soldier (2014)</h4>
						<img src="http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/captain-america-the-winter-soldier-uk-poster.jpg" height="300" width="200" />
						<br>
						<br><p>Winter Soldier changed many things when it came out. It changed the state of the MCU, and it elevated Cap to A-list status. Withs it visceral, exhilirating action, and smartly told political thriller
						plot, it is one of the best films of the MCU.</p>
						</p>
						<br>
						
						<h4>Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)</h4>
						<img src="http://1.media.dorkly.cvcdn.com/26/95/18b149286ca6f2920e017bd5d2ffcbf5.jpg" height="300" width="200" />
						<br>
						<br><p>The surprise hit by Marvel that took a rogue outlaw, a green assasin, a tattooed maniac, a talking tree and a talking raccoon and made them household names, GOTG is full of heart, fun
						and excitement, demonstrating that Marvel knows no bounds in their genre exploring.</p>
						
						<br>
						
						<h4>Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)</h4>
						<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1b/Avengers_Age_of_Ultron.jpg" height="300" width="200" />
						<br>
						<br><p>The sequel to one of the biggest movies of all time, Age of Ultron had its flaws but it told a globe-hopping, epic story that dove deeper into the personal lives of the Avengers
						and whose world-building is now only starting to pay off in spades in upcoming movies.</p>
					
						<br>
						
						
						
						<h4>Ant-Man (2015)</h4>
						<img src="http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ant-man-poster-1.jpg" height="300" width="200" />
						<br>
						<br><p>The smallest film yet in terms of character and budget yet arguably the one with the biggest heart. The story of a reformed thief who utilizes the amazing shrinking tech of the Ant-Man suit
						to make a better future for his daughter.</p>
						
						<br>
						
						<h3>PHASE 3</h3>
						<h4>Captain America: Civil War (2016)</h4>
						<img src="http://www.joblo.com/posters/images/full/Captain-America-Civil-War-main-poster.jpg" height="300" width="200" />
						<br>
						<br><p>Capitalizing on years of well-earned character development, Civil War takes the Avengers to new depths personally and is one of the best movies in the MCU. Its mature, dramatic examination
						of the destructive battles and exploits of the Avengers told through a very tightly, scripted and emotional story is nothing short of astounding. That it did not buckle under the weight of all the 
						characters it contained, not to mention new ones, is a testamount to the power of Marvel. </p>
						<br>
						<p>
						</p>
						<br>
						
						<h4>Dr. Strange (2016)</h4>
						<img src="http://static.srcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/Doctor-Strange-Poster.jpg" height="300" width="200" />
						<br>
						<br><p>In its effort to expand and keep refreshing the genre, Marvel Studios comes out with its freshest film yet in Dr. Strange full of psychedlic visuals, inventive sequenes, and a 
						very heartfelt, and inspiring story carried on Benedict Cumberbatch's excellent acting.</p>
						<br>
						<p>
						</p>
						<br>
						<h4>MORE excellent films to come in Phase 3 including the biggest of them all, Infinity War. The most amazing film with the best cast and excellent director in Black Panther, Homecoming, Ragnarok
						and Guardians...</h4>
