						<h3>PHASE 1</H3>

						<h4>Daredevil (2015)</h4>
						<img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91GZUkNIYPL._SL1500_.jpg" height="300" width="200" />
						<br>
						<br><p>Like Iron Man, Daredevil came out of the gates strong, setting the bar for the Netflix shows. Dark, gritty, powerfully told, with excellent character development
						and realistic fight choreography. Marvel proved once again that they can expand into different corners of their universe. With Daredevil came a very dark, grounded, and human story about vigilantes
						on the street, corruption, gentrification, and the human struggle</p>
						</p>
						<br>
						<h4>Jessica Jones (2015)</h4>
						<img src="http://cdn2-www.superherohype.com/assets/uploads/gallery/marvels-jessica-jones/jessicajonesposter.jpg" height="300" width="200" />
						<br>
						<br><p>The most tonally different of the Netflix shows, Jessica Jones tells a powerful story of abuse, trauma, and recovery of Jessica Jones, an ex-superhero PI who
						struggles to recover from the abuse she suffered at the hands of the telepathic villain Kilgrave. It is a powerful story of empowerment, rape and examines the consequences 
						of such a struggle.</p>
						</p>
						<br>
						<h4>Luke Cage (2016)</h4>
						<img src="http://cdn3-www.comingsoon.net/assets/uploads/gallery/luke-cage-set/cpvqrbzusaa3s3v.jpg" height="300" width="200" />
						<br>
						<br><p>Its most authentic story yet. Marvel shows another side of their stories in this soulful, telling of Black American culture through the eyes of Luke Cage, the wrongfully convicted
						ex-con with unbreakable skin.</p>
						</p>
						<br>
						<br>
						<h4>Iron Fist(2017)</h4>
						<img src="http://cdn3-www.comingsoon.net/assets/uploads/gallery/iron-fist/vlcsnap-00020.png" height="300" width="200" />
						<br>
						<br><p>Still to come, Iron Fist tells the story of martial artist Danny Rand who returns to NYC after being missing for 17 years..</p>
						<br> 
						
						<h4>The Defenders (2017)</h4>
						<img src="https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/00111700-ew1449.jpg?w=1600&h=2133" height="300" width="200" />
						<br>
						<br><p>Defenders unites Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist in another GROUNDBREAKING, and unique EVENT. This show promises to take the grounded street tone
						of the previous shows and unite them to create something very emotional, powerful, and epic. An event truly earned through years of wait.</p>
						<br>
						<h4>The Punisher (2017)</h4>
						<img src="http://www.flickeringmyth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/The-Punisher-Netflix-series.jpg" height="300" width="300" />
						<br>
						<br><p>Off the excellent, ground-breaking portrayal of Frank Castle in season 2 of Daredevil, The Punisher is a show about an ex-soldier who had his family horrifically gunned down in front of him.
						After this, he fights a one-man-war against crime, brutally doing what other heroes won't: killing, murdering and desposing of criminals. The harrowing story of a man so deep into darkness yet
						tries to accomplish something with it.</p>
